# Etch a Sketch
This project is from [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).


## What I learned
In this project, I learned that you can declare global css variables in the :root pseudo class selector. I also solidified my DOM manipulation skills by making a responsive slider that can manipulate the contents of the grid.
